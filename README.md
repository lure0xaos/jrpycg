# RenPy Cheat Generator - Swing Edition

## Edition notes

This is downgrade successor of [RenPy Cheat Generator](https://github.com/lure0xaos/rpycg) because its JavaFX tree
component sometimes looks weird
It's feature complete comparing to RPyCG:

- visual tree builder, grouping to submenus, with different variable types and optionally fixed value
- text creator with syntax highlighting
- save, load and template (example) generation
- settings to fine python code generation
- game folder only tree-based directory selection
- multi-language UI (English and Russian for now)

## The latest changes

## Notes from RPyCG

> I created this to make it easier to make custom cheat menus for RenPy games, its basically a text editor where you can
> make a menu and open it ingame. The only requirement is that you know the name of the variables.

based on [this f95 thread](https://f95zone.to/threads/renpy-cheat-generator.14104/)
(thanks to [@Aziien](https://f95zone.to/members/aziien.13215/))

### Features:

- Enables console.
- Get list of current used variables + values to file "Game Variables.txt" in game root dir
  (Default to 'M' if enabled in settings)
- Adds editable shortcut to console (Default to 'Shift+O') and cheat menu (Default to 'Shift+C').
- Add variables and menus with simple button click. (Menus can be placed in menus)
- Drag & Drop to modify order of items.
- Text editor, for the more advanced users, its basically a bare bone script system.
- Generate the button with generate a menu which will be copied to the clipboard.
- Install will create a file named 'CustomCheatMenu.rpy' at selected location.

#### Variable types:

- **variable_name(str)** (Will make a menuitem with the selected variable and ask for input ingame)
- **variable_name(str);custom_text** (Same as above, however will have custom text)
- **variable_name(int)=500** (Fixed variable, will set value to specify)
- **variable_name(int)=500;custom_text** (Same as before, will show custom text)
- **\<menu_title** (Creates a menu, everything between start and end will be added to menu)
- **\>** (Ends the menu)

#### Warning:

Use the cheats generated with care, as you might break something in your game if you modify the wrong variables. Using
the function to write game variables to a file is experimental, please be cautious while using it. Feedback is much
appreciated.
(Preview game is 'Corruption')

### Developer notes:

Although application mimic the original, it has some differences:

- Variables now have types defined (string, integer and float)
- String variables can have quotes (single quotes or double quotes)
- Builder is a tree style and so no need for special "End of menu" marker
- Column built-in sorting and resizing
- When installing, select game directory, and cheat will be placed at correct location
- I would recommend grouping variables by menus, as excess of variables will be offscreen
